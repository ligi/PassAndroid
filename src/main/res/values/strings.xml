<h1>What is it?</h1>

This app is a viewer for passbooks - a passbook could be a e.g. <b>boarding-pass</b> for your next flight, a coupon for a nice hot beverage on the destination, a movie ticket, a membership card - there are a lot of possibilities.
Basically it is a replacement for a piece of paper or plastic you would normally have to carry with you - so lets save some trees and <b>reduce waste!</b>

<h1>Example passes</h1>

Do you need some passes to play around and see things in action? <a href=\'http://ligi.de/passandroid_samples/index.html\'>Here are some</a> for you!

<h1>How does it work?</h1>

There are so called pkpass files - you can open them with this app - e.g. when you receive them via email or get an Download-option. The most important content is the BarCode ( QR , AZTEC & PDF417which authorizes you most of the time - but it also has other interesting content like a description - often a time (hat you now can add to your calendar  - often also locations (o give you directions) - just try It out!
The app is offline usable once you downloaded the pass!

<h1>History</h1>

I stumbled upon Passbook files when i received my ticket for the 29c3 - I liked the Idea - but there was no Android App which was working for me. I saw that the implementation is quite easy ( just a zip container with json and images ) - The first version was build very quick & was working for me ( got entry to 29C3 ) - In the following year I have not worked on this app much as I had no real use-cases but there where a lot of users downloading the app ( nearly 100k now ) and I fixed processing of some passes that where send to me ( some passes contain really broken json .. )
One year later - just before the 30C3 - I came to work a bit on this app again - for 2 reasons:
 - a friend of mine is very into this whole BTLE thing and location beacon / context aware thing could be interesting for Passbook - but nothing ready yet
 - I got a mail from a nice designer who did a nice redesign
This all was leading to PassAndroid - a completely new version - with a new look and new functions (sorting and adding to calendar alongside pull to refresh a navigation drawer and contextual ActionBar menu
